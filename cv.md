## Work experience

### 2010 november - till now
, Senior JavaScript developer,  Informaat IPE BV,  Baarn

( <http://www.informaat-cxp.com/> )
	
__Department__ 	: R&D

__Achievements__ :	 
	
* Architecturing and implementing schema based persistence layer ( using node.js, mongo and websockets. )

	__Description__: This machinary helps Informaat to extend Domain Model of our application  without need to touch any part of the backend code and enables us to have immediate realtime persistence within the browser. While backend and schemas are relational, data on the client is Document based, which gives developers power and freedom to work with it. 


* Building single-page data-driven client framework for Customer Experience Platform ( CXP ) “Dialogica” ( using knockout.js )

	__Description__: This framework is using "model" to display single-page application in the browser. The application flow and data flow of the ui is fully drivven by the "model" itself. You can think of the model, like "configuration" of the single-page application. Model is drawn in Dialogica in a form of a data flow diagrams whih is interpreted by the client framework.   

* Establishing “Continuous Deployment” process ( using jenkins and bash-scripting )

	__Description__: Setting up jenknis jobs and pre-commit hooks in order to guarantee one click deployment mechanism

* Setting up UI testing framework ( using Selenium webdriver )

	__Description__: Before Protractor of angular came out, had to write test runner which could execute tests ( in javascript ) using selenium and report them to the jenknis.
		
* Building selfcontained "Development environment” ( using vagrant, bash-scripting and python )

	__Description__: Because of use of some legacy systems which could not run on various platforms like OSX, introduced and implemented vagrant virtual machine with all the skeleton code and helpfull tools for fast bootstrap of development.

* Coach developers for "JavaScript best practices"

* Build ??? on top of "git"

__Keywords__: node.js, mongo, knockout.js, git, bash-scripting, python, angular.js, jenkins


######  2008 february - 2010 october: , Senior JavaScript developer, Mendix BV, Rotterdam

__Keywords__: IE6 performance, memory analysis,  


######  2007 september - 2008 february: Greduate student, Mendix, Rotterdam

As my final part of the education I had to do "thesis" which I've "executed" at mendix aswel….

__Department__ 	: R&D

__Achievements__ :

* Front-end core in JavaScript

* Server side in Java

__Keywords__: Comet, 

###### 2006 may - 2007 february : Dual student, Mendix, Rotterdam

After I finished my internship by Mendix I have decided to stay there. Because I was still studen I had to switch to the "Dual education" so that I could combine work and study together.

When working there as a dual student, I had to perform different tasks, not only related to the javascript and dojo, but also to the C# and Java.

__Department__ 	: R&D

__Achievements__ :

* Implmeneted Webservices module for backend system in Java ( using Apache Axis ) and implemented extra layer to handle DIME attachements.
	
One of my projects in that period of time was to implement Webservice layer inside Mendix Application Server, so that it could connect to the webservices. The one unusual aspect of that project was, that this module had to support also DIME attachements.

* Implemented "Planner" UI-module ( in JavaScript )
	
This was custom widget to have minimal ui for Gantt chart like planngins. A lot of Drag and Drop ( dnd ) logic was invloved and at that time it also had to perform on IE6, so that was a bit challange. The knowldge of the dnd and performance tricks of dnd I also reused in another project "Web-Portal" 

* Creating Planning module for Mendix Business Modeler ( in C# )

In order to use planner module in the client, it also had to be implemented inside Modeler tooling, so that it could be included in the builded app. All work was done inside Mendix Business Modeler using .Net C# and GDI+.

* Implementing portal ( in JavaScript )

iGoogle at that time was something very sweet to look at, all this configurable portlets with different information, customizable for every user. It was something what was attractive for a lot of people and Mendix decided to include such possibility inside their platform. Mostly I was creating set of custom widgets and creating infrastructure for configurable 'portlets'. Again, dnd was, on-fly save of configuration and other effects were the challenging parts


__Keywords__: WSDL, SOAP, Dime, .NET C#, IE6, DND

##### 2005 november - 2006 may: Junior JavaScript developer,  Mendix, Rotterdam

Started working at Mendix <http://mendix.com> as student ( Intern/Internship ).

This was the beginning of the Mendix history and my proffesional career. Their idea is very simple, to build, run and deploy app using Mendidx Platform. Mendix Platform includes Business Modeler, which is used to build an app ( using form builder ) and deploy it to the Mendix Application Server. Mendix Client Framework, single-page client framework which runs deployed app in the browser.

__Department__ 	: R&D

__Achievements__ :

* Creating widgets for web-based client framework ( using dojotoolkit )

At that time Mendix Client Framework was based on the dojotoolkit ( http://dojotoolkit.org/), and even though dojo had at that time already some stack of ui widgets, there was a lack for custom widgets which Mendix was planning to use. So my role as a student at this startup company was to code different custom widgets and other ui components.

* Thesis: Composition versus Inheritance in Java

As an intern student I also had to write a thesis. My subject was "Composition versus Inheritance in Java". The main idea of it was to see what does bring compision in place of inheritance. Does it solve problem of deep hyerarhical erlations.  Also I looked not only at the maintances problem of the inheritance but at the memory consumption when composition used and inheritance.
